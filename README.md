Module for cooperatio between the Apache Tapestry (https://tapestry.apache.org/) and Apache Cayenne 
(http://cayenne.apache.org/)

Long time ago - in 1995 - the Web Objects framework (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebObjects) was founded by Next company led by Steve Jobs. The essential part of the Web Objects is the Enterprise Objects framework (EOF)
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_Objects_Framework). The Apache Tapestry design philosophy is very same as the 
Web Objects and Apache Cayenne philosophy is very similar to EOF. The module tapestry5-cayenne allows mariage of those 
proven technologies.
